Solana AI Hedge Syndicate
An AI-powered decentralized prediction hedge fund using Solana, Polymarket, Gemini, and Snowflake.
🚀 Overview

Solana AI Hedge Syndicate is a decentralized, AI-governed prediction fund that autonomously trades on Polymarket using strategies generated by Google Gemini, powered by historical analytics stored in Snowflake, and enforced through on-chain governance via Solana.

Users stake capital into a Solana vault, vote on AI-generated trade proposals, and share in the fund’s profits.
All trades, strategies, and performance metrics are transparent, auditable, and stored on-chain.

This project showcases:

AI-driven trading

Cross-chain execution

Real-time data engineering

Fully decentralized governance

High-performance infrastructure

🧪 How It Works

1. Data Pipeline → Snowflake

Backend streams Polymarket data + Solana logs directly into Snowflake tables.

2. Feature Store → Gemini

Gemini reads curated features (orderflow, volatility, catalysts) to produce strategy plans.

3. Strategy Hash → Solana Governance

Gemini’s proposal is hashed and proposed on-chain.

4. Users Vote

Stakers vote YES/NO through the frontend.

5. Approved → Execution

Execution bot places orders on Polymarket CLOB.

6. PnL → Snowflake → Daily Reports

Performance metrics are calculated and posted on-chain.
